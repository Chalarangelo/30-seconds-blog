By default, when JavaScript sees an escape character (`\`), it will escape the character after it. However, there are cases where you might not want this behavior (e.g. when you want to store a Windows path as a string). For these cases, you can use a template literal and the `String.raw()` tag function:

```js
const path = `C:\web\index.html`; // 'C:web.html'

const unescapedPath = String.raw`C:\web\index.html`; // 'C:\web\index.html'
```
